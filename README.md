# Traffic Analysis using Computer Vision
This project aims to perform real-time traffic analysis using computer vision techniques to detect and analyze vehicles, pedestrians, bikes, and other objects in a video stream. The project utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and stores the detected data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for further processing and analysis.

## Overview
The traffic analysis system is designed to capture and process real-time video feeds. Using the YOLOv8 model for object detection, the system identifies different types of objects such as cars, bikes, and people, and stores this data in MongoDB for further analysis. The goal is to provide insights into traffic patterns and help in decision-making processes such as traffic flow improvements or predicting future traffic congestion.

## Features
- **Real-time object detection**: Detects vehicles, bikes, pedestrians, and other objects in live video streams using YOLOv8.
- **Data storage in MongoDB**: All detected objects and their metadata are stored in a MongoDB database.
- **ETL pipeline optimization**: Efficient extraction, transformation, and loading of data from video streams.
- **Automated reporting and insights generation**: Generate automated reports based on historical and live data.
- **Predictive analytics and traffic forecasting**: Use machine learning techniques to forecast traffic congestion and other patterns.
- **Real-time dashboard and visualization**: A dashboard to visualize live and historical traffic data with graphical representations.
- **Dockerize everything**: Containerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8 for object detection.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing object data.
- **Python Libraries**:
    - `opencv` for video processing.
    - `pymongo` for MongoDB interaction.
    - `pytorch` for handling YOLOv8 models.
    - `ssh_pymongo` for SSH connection to remote MongoDB instances.
    - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
    - `streamlit` for creating the real-time dashboard.

## Implementations
- **Automated Reporting and Insights Generation**: Implemented logic to automatically generate reports based on traffic data trends.
- **Predictive Analytics and Traffic Forecasting**: Using machine learning models to predict future traffic conditions based on historical data.
- **Real-time Dashboard and Visualization**: Developed a dashboard that shows live traffic updates, trends, and historical data analysis using visualization libraries like Plotly and Streamlit.

## Future Implementations
- **Enhanced Predictive Models**: Improve the accuracy and efficiency of predictive models for traffic forecasting.
- **Integration with Traffic Management Systems**: Integrate the system with existing traffic management systems for real-time traffic control and optimization.
- **Scalability Improvements**: Enhance the scalability of the system to handle larger datasets and more video streams simultaneously.
